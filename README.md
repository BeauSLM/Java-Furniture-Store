# ENSF409-Project
Final Project for ENSF 409

# ABOUT THE EXTRA FILES

These files are there to tell intellij information about the project. If you don't use intellij, that's alright just leave them alone. 
This is because if you delete them on your system, github will nag you to commit and delete them from the repository entirely, which 
would cause them to get removed from _everyone's_ system, possibly breaking their intellij. 

ALSO DON'T MESS WITH THE GITIGNORE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD just ask me if you need to add something :).
